 convertpattern - convert pattern (*.DEC) into shape file (*.RF) (UNIX/M)

      Syntax: convertpattern pattern_name dres		(UNIX)
	      convertpattern<(pattern_name<,dres>)>	(VNMR)

 Description: convertpattern converts a pattern definition file
	      (shapelib/*.DEC)  into a pulse shape definition
	      (shapelib/*.RF). This is done by changing the column
	      order (2->1, 3->2, 1->3, 4->4). Comment and empty lines
	      are simply transferred to the target file; if column 3 is
	      missing in the pattern file, a 1023.0 is filled into column 1;
	      column 4 is transferred only if defined in the source file.
	      Column 3 of the shape file is calculated from column 1
	      of the pattern file by dividing the tip angle by the
	      specified tip angle resolution (dres); if dres is not
	      specified, the value from the dres parameter is taken.
	      The target file will be created in the user's shapelib
	      directory; the body of the name will be the same as for the
	      pulse shape definition file.
	      Note that convertpattern will abort if the target pattern
	      already exists.

   Arguments: pattern_name is the decoupler pattern to convert. If it is
		not dpecified, the value of the dseq parameter is taken
		instead (for calls from VNMR only). The name can be specified
		with or without extension, and also as relative or absolute
		pathname.
	      dres is the second, optional argument; if it is not specified,
		the value of the dres parameter in the current experiment
		is taken instead (for calls from VNMR only).

    Examples: convertpattern mlev16.DEC 90
	      convertpattern garp1 1
	      convertpattern /home/vnmr2/vnmrsys/shapelib/waltz64 90
	      convertpattern /home/vnmr2/vnmrsys/shapelib/waltz64.RF 90
	      convertpattern				[ from VNMR ]
	      convertpattern('mlev17')			[ from VNMR ]
	      convertpattern('garp1',1)			[ from VNMR ]
