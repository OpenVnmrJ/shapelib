 convertshape - convert shape (*.RF) into pattern file (*.DEC) (UNIX/M)
************************************************************************

      Syntax: convertshape shapename		(UNIX)
	      convertshape(shapename)		(VNMR)

 Description: convertshape converts a pulse shape definition
	      (shapelib/*.RF) into a pattern definition file
	      (shapelib/*.DEC). This is done by changing the column
	      order (3->1, 1->2, 2->3, 4->4). Comment and empty lines
	      are simply transferred to the target file; if column 3 is
	      missing in the shape file, a 1.0 is filled into column 1;
	      column 4 is transferred only if defined in the source file.
	      The target file will be created in the user's shapelib
	      directory; the body of the name will be the same as for the
	      pulse shape definition file.
	      Note that convertshape will abort if the target shape already
	      exists.
	      To use the newly created decoupling pattern, set dres=1;
	      decoupler pattern from pulse shapes will usually have a 1.0
	      in the first column (1 degree flip angle per slice at B1max).

   Arguments: the only argument to convertshape is the name of the source
	      (pulse shape) file, with or without extension. This file
	      can be located either in the local shapelib, or in the global
	      directory /vnmr/shapelib, and it can also be specified as
	      absolute pathname (with or without extension). The target
	      file will always be created in the local shapelib directory.

    Examples: convertshape iburp.RF
	      convertshape reburp
	      convertshape /home/vnmr2/vnmrsys/shapelib/reburp
	      convertshape /home/vnmr2/vnmrsys/shapelib/reburp.RF
	      convertshape('hrm180')		[ from VNMR ]
